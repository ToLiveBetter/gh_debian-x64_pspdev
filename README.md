# gh_debian-x64_pspdev
This is a compiled psptoolchain(pspsdk included) on  debian x64 platform //ubuntu is also ok
Problem
When you clone it directly,the files in  prebuilt-toolchain/libexec/gcc/psp/4.9.3/,liblto_plugin.so liblto_plugin.so.0 may miss.
Please see them on github and add them manually on your local machine
